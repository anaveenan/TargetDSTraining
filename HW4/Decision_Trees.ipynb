At each stage of the tree there are some possibilities we’ve eliminated and some that we haven’t. After learning that an animal doesn’t have more than five legs, we’ve eliminated the possibility that it’s a grasshopper. We haven’t eliminated the possibility that it’s a duck. Every possible question partitions the remaining possibilities according to their answers.  \n",

If there’s a single yes/no question for which 'yes' answers always correspond to True outputs and 'no' answers to False outputs (or vice versa), this would be an awesome question to pick. Conversely, a yes/no question for which neither answer gives you much new information about what the prediction should be is probably not a good choice.\n",

If all the data points belong to a single class, then there is no real uncertainty, which means we’d like there to be low entropy.  If the data points are evenly spread across the classes, there is a lot of uncertainty and we’d like there to be high entropy.  \n",

For example, imagine you work for a bank and are trying to build a decision tree to predict which of your customers are likely to default on their mortgages, using some historical data as your training set. Imagine further that the data set contains each customer’s Social Security number. Partitioning on SSN will produce one-person subsets, each of which necessarily has zero entropy.

Rather than training each tree on all the inputs in the training set, we train each tree on the result of `bootstrap_sample(inputs)`. Since each tree is built using different data, each tree will be different from every other tree. (A side benefit is that it’s totally fair to use the nonsampled data to test each tree, which means you can get away with using all of your data as the training set if you are clever in how you measure performance.) This technique is known as *bootstrap aggregating* or *bagging*.  \n",
