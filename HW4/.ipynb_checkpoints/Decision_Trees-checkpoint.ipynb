At each stage of the tree there are some possibilities we’ve eliminated and some that we haven’t.

Every possible question partitions the remaining possibilities according to their answers.  \n",

Conversely, a yes/no question for which neither answer gives you much new information about what the prediction should be is probably not a good choice.\n",

Imagine further that the data set contains each customer’s Social Security number. Partitioning on SSN will produce one-person subsets, each of which necessarily has zero entropy.
